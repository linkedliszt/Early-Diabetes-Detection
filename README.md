# Early-Diabetes-Detection
## UpLevel Data Science Project

This is an end-to-end data science project from a code-along course in UpLevel Data Science.

### Context 
As a data scientist in the epidemiolody department, the government is waging a war against diabetes and you are at the frontline. My weapon is my Python skills, and the bullets are data. 
In this project, I learnt to trained a machine learning model to predict whether an individual is at risk of developing diabetes. 

Refer to Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb for my python code.
